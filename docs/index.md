## Usage

### Basic Usage

When you run Vampire Hunter, it will:

1. Scan your system for processes listening on TCP ports
2. Display them in a formatted table with memory usage
3. Present an interactive menu for managing processes

### Interactive Menu Options

- **Number**: Enter the ID of a process to kill it
- **a**: Kill all processes (with confirmation)
- **r**: Refresh the process list
- **q**: Quit the program

### Example Output

```
+----+-------+------------+-----------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+
| ID | PID   | Name       | Port            | Memory   | Command                                     |
+====+=======+============+=================+==========+=============================================+

| 3  | 9012  | webpack    | *:8080          | 120.5 MB | webpack serve --mode development            |
+----+-------+------------+-----------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+

ðŸ”¹ Total processes: 3
ðŸ”¹ Total estimated memory usage: 197.8 MB

Select action:
  Enter number to kill a specific process
  'a' to kill ALL processes
  'r' to refresh the list
  'q' to quit
Choice:
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Command Line Arguments

Vampire Hunter supports the following command line arguments:

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message

### Environment Variables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Some processes may require administrator privileges to kill
   - Solution: Run Vampire Hunter with sudo (not recommended for regular use)

2. **Process Not Found**: A process may have ended between scanning and killing
   - Solution: Refresh the list with 'r'

3. **Module Not Found**: Missing dependencies
   - Solution: Install required packages with `pip3 install tabulate psutil`

## FAQ

### What are "vampire processes"?

Vampire processes are server processes that continue running in the background, consuming system resources without your active use. They're commonly created during development when starting local servers for testing.

### Is it safe to kill all processes?

Vampire Hunter asks for confirmation before killing any processes. However, be cautious when using the "kill all" option, as it will terminate all detected server processes, which might include important system services.

### Can Vampire Hunter harm my system?

Vampire Hunter is designed to be safe:
- It only targets processes listening on TCP ports
- It asks for confirmation before killing processes
- It uses graceful termination first
- It provides detailed information about each process

### Does Vampire Hunter work on Windows?

Vampire Hunter works on Windows through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Native Windows support may be added in future versions.

### How often should I run Vampire Hunter?

You can run Vampire Hunter whenever you notice your system slowing down or when you want to clean up unused server processes. There's no harm in running it frequently.
